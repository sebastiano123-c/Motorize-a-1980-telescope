\section{Final setup and considerations}
After lots of hours testing our telescope, we can declare what is the best configuration found using the Wemos D1 \+ CNC3 shield card.
This section is a sort of recap telling you which are the best components to use.

The best drivers are the TMC2209.
They are the most silent, the most quick and precise.
They are used in our setup for the RA and DEC motors.
Otherwise for the focuser the TMC2208 driver has been used. 

The best stepper motor is the 17HM19-2004S1 for its superior precision and power, and we have used it in the RA mechanization.
It is worth noticing that the most used one in others project is the 17HM15-0904S stepper motor.
We have tested it both in the DEC and the RA mechanization, and it does its own work;
we have used it in the DEC mechanization.
