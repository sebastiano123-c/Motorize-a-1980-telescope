\section{Tracking}
\label{sec:tracking}
Sidereal tracking is done by the OnStep software, of course.
Otherwise, since the polar alignment may not be perfect we have decided to equip the telescope with an auto-guiding system controlled by the PHD2 app.
This, in our mind, should optimize the tracking and permits long-exposure photography which is necessary for optimal results.

Although separated by the previously mechanization, this auto-guiding system interacts with the mount using ASCOM OnStep telescope drivers, and provide corrections to the tracking.

\subsection{Telescope guidescope}
On the telescope is fixed a 240mm focal length guidescope Svbony SV106.

\subsection{Guidescope camera}
The camera is an old red webcam inserted into the guidescope using an adpter.\footnote{See this useful tutorial \url{https://telescopeguides.com/how-to-use-a-webcam-with-a-telescope/}.}

The result is pretty weird, but it works!
Just look at the following sections PHD2 logs!
