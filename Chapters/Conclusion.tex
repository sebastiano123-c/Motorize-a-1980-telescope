\section{Conclusion}
As seen in the test section \ref{sec:tests}, the result are encouraging.
The auto-guide seem to be stable and quite good since, \textit{e.g.} the RMS is lower than 1 for RA and DEC.
Photography with this configuration have been set up with more than 2 minutes per pose (which was impossible for us before the devolving of this project).

As a final consideration, before buying an expensive telescope and mount, consider the idea of converting your own old telescope and the lets play with it!
