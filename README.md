## _Kepler1 - a OnStep project_
</h> -->

# Description
If you, like me, find an old dusty telescope in our garage, wouldnâ€™t you want it to work like one of the best motorized telescopes? Here, you will find the transformation of my equatorial Urania telescope on the way to 2.0.

# Theory
All the steps are reported in the [documentation](https://github.com/sebastiano123-c/Motorize-a-1980-telescope/blob/main/documentation.pdf).
The software parts are provided by [OnStep](https://github.com/hjd1964/OnStep) and there you'll find how to install the software and choose your best approach that fits your mount.
3D printed parts are stored in the [Hardware](https://github.com/sebastiano123-c/Motorize-a-1980-telescope/tree/main/Hardware) folder.
Pinout design for the electronic parts are visible in the [Setup](https://github.com/sebastiano123-c/Motorize-a-1980-telescope/tree/main/Setup) folder.

# Roadmap
In the future, we will try to obtain better tracking resolutions and faster slew rates.
