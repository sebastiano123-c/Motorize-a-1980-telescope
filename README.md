# Motorize-1980-telescope
If you, like me, find an old and dusty telescope in our garage, wouldn't you want it to work as the best motorized telescopes?
Here, you will find the transformation of my Urania equatorial telescope on the way to 2.0.

# Description
In this repo you find a _roadmap_ to modernize your telescope mount.
The software parts are provided by [OnStep](https://github.com/hjd1964/OnStep) and there you'll find how to install the software and choose your best approach that fits your mount.

# Theory
All the steps are reported in the [documentation](https://github.com/sebastiano123-c/Motorize-1980-dads-telescope/blob/main/documentation.pdf).
3D printed parts are stored in the hardware folder.
